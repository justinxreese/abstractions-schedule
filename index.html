                  We've been playing with computers since 1948.  Software and computers have changed the world.  But we still don't know how to program them reliably, and we haven't quite figured out what to do with them.
                  In this lecture I'll talk about the history of computing, complexity and why programming is difficult.  I'll outline the dangers that we are facing, which problems we ought to be solving and how we should approach programming as a mental discipline.

                  Imagine: never again reading the words `'undefined' is not a function`! Sure, you can use Flow or TypeScript to avoid type errors _most_ of the time, but it's optional and anyone can turn it off whenever they want. Now imagine: never being able to alter data that you shouldn't be able to, lest another part of your application become inconsistent. Yes, you can use Immutable, Mori, or any one of the libraries that exist to provide immutable data structures, but sometimes you'll miss the familiarity and convenience of built-in syntax. Now lastly, imagine the reactivity of a browser environment as a first-class construct. You _could_ use RxJS, Bacon, or Kefyr to get some of that functionality as an additional library, but JavaScript isn't designed around these concepts.
                  
                  Elm provides all of these things and more at the language level. The world's friendliest compiler will guide you toward apps that are expressive and free of runtime errors. Elm's type system and compiler make every step of the development lifecycle enjoyable and allow developers to proceed confidently when refactoring large codebases. _Everything_ in Elm is immutable, from custom record types to familiar data structures like `List` and `Dict`. Elm's `Signal` provides a fundamental focus on reactivity, allowing developers to build their UIs as they truly are: a function of an ever-changing data model. Most importantly, however, it provides all of these things without compromising ease of use. The language was designed with the user in mind, not math, and the community's attitude toward beginners follows suit.
                  
                  In this talk I'll demonstrate the raw power of Elm as a browser language and the advantages it provides over even the latest and greatest JavaScript innovations. I'll show code samples and demonstrate the application architecture that arises naturally from the language's constructs. Importantly, though, I'll also speak about the language's community, learning resources, and ecosystem. Elm's creator, Evan Czaplicki, wants the language to push functional programming into the mainstream and the Elm community has rallied behind the friendliness of the language to become amazingly encouraging for new users.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  This talk is for anyone in a project leadership role or who finds themselves dealing directly with stakeholders.  
                  
                  Expect to see stakeholder interviews from a new perspective--as a golden opportunity rather than a chore. You’ll learn both principles and practical strategies. For example:
                  
                  1. **Ask stakeholders about their hopes and fears.** Really. Ask them what gives them anxiety when they think about this project/release/prototype. “What keeps you up at night?” is a good way to phrase this question. Once people get the anxieties out of their heads they’ll feel better, and you’ll know where potential conflict lies.
                  
                  2. **Talk with stakeholders individually.** Part of the value of these interviews is the signal you send a person by scheduling 30 minutes for the sole purpose of understanding their point of view.  Group interviews are a tempting time-saver, but they aren’t worth it.

                  When creating a new REST platform, the planning process frequently gets skipped (or is misunderstood) resulting in an ill-conceived API. I’ll walk you through the steps needed to create an API that developers love, and point out the common traps to avoid.
                  
                  The presentation will cover creating user stories, deciding on metrics, planning the API, design decisions, documentation and developer support. I will focus on creating a developer experience that will delight and amaze your developer partners and increase engagement with your platform. This talk will focus on higher level choices rather than HTTP architecture, and is appropriate for developers, product managers, or anyone else with an interest in achieving success for their API program.
                  
                  The Open API Ecosystem is an amazing opportunity for companies to partner with developers, but you really only get one chance to impress, so come learn how to make your company’s API an “A List” destination.

                  "A webpage" tends to be the default UI for most JS developers, but for  many tasks this is overkill or not ideally suited for the purpose. Everyone who's used node/io.js has probably written simple scripts to invoke via `node myscript.js`, but what if you want to build something more robust, add online docs, or distribute it via npm for easy -g install? If so, you're in luck! There are many great libs & frameworks to ease the development of shell tools & every JS dev should build at least one, IMO!
                  
                  In this talk I plan to walk viewers thru the process of building a shell tool: handling input, formatting output, and packaging a tool for installation. We’ll touch on minimist, commander, chalk, cli-table, inquirer and more as we build a simple script into a full blown command line application complete with help output & man-pages, and more!

                <p class='session-description'>Design and tech are happily co-evolving, as we are seeing more and more companies understanding the important of UX in their products. But how can you elevate a good UX to a great UX? It's all in the details - specifically, it's all about the *micro-interactions*: the moments of interactions that happen nearly invisibly, and often across miniuscle moments, but can make the user experience so much more enjoyable. In this talk, you'll learn through a plethora of examples how much a little bit of attention to micro-interactions can elevate a good UI. Often times, micro-interactions do not serve functional purposes, but are meant to deepen the user engagement with your app by delighting the user through small moments of triggers and feedback. Examples of micro-interactions focus around motion, color, copy, and simplicity. You'll learn how to dissect these types of interactions, so that you too can start adding micro-interactions in your own app. Walk away inspired by the examples and ready to delight your users!</p>

                  Do you only use your command line prompt to run some commands and launch your text editor? It can do more! In this talk we'll dive through a series of incredibly awesome plugins, scripts, and tools that transform the boring command line into a powerhouse of awesomeness!
                  
                  Syntax highlighting in the prompt? You got it! How about gentle autocompletion of recent commands? Sure! Even tools for data analysis? Of course! We will analyze all the data, right in text! If there's time, we'll even extend git with a few nice commands just because we can.

                  Talking to adults about security culture is only a small part of the problem. We really need to be thinking about how raising and mentoring the next generation is our way to change culture. We are at a crossroads where we can either teach children that their only safety lies in compliance and censorship, or we can give them tools and mental models for how to stay (reasonably) safe in an unreasonable world. 
                  If we could get even a small percentage of children to spread ideas about psuedonymity and data protection to their peers, we would be changing the future of educational, corporate, and government responses.  
                  
                  Infosec is like sex ed. If you wait until kids need it, you have waited too long.
                  Schools don't, peers can't, we have to. 
                  
                  As security professionals, we spend a lot of time educating adults on how to be safer, how to protect themselves, how to be security aware. But if we really want to change the culture, we have to start earlier. We have to teach kids what information they should never give out. We have to give them methods to evaluate the truth of what they are reading. And we have to prevent them from  becoming the next generation of jerks.
                  
                  This talk is not about net nannies, monitoring your router traffic, or behaving like a security organization in your home. It's about genuinely teaching new humans how to behave in an environment we had to figure out the hard way.
                  
                  It'll be about 
                  - troll-proofing your kids (I/O)
                  
                  - privacy and autonomy
                  
                  - identity and sharding
                  
                  - optimism
                  
                  - information jubilee
                  
                  - and how kids are like automation scripts.
                  
                  
                  Information security as a life practice is not something we're taught, it's something we have absorbed in our time in the industry. How can we distill all that life-experience into something that we can teach and pass on? This talk is for everyone with a n00b in their lives, or anyone who isn't sure how to keep themselves safe(ish).

I was also completely unprepared for the challenges of being so new to both journeys. After reaching out to fellow parent-developers, I learned that there are common challenges and opportunities that aren’t regularly spoken about in our community. We’ll explore the similarities between these two journeys through common approaches we use when coding and raising a child, and how we as a community can be more responsive and understanding of the large percentage of developers who are current or future parents. Whether you’re a parent or not, come discover these interesting and sometimes hilarious parallels and opportunities. </p>

Postgres has some powerful functionality that can help transform data from a giant pile of stuff into something actionable and useful. I will show how to take advantage of the JSON datatype, Common Table Expression, and materialized views to build impressive data visualizations.</p>

                <p class='session-description'>In popular culture, the Turing Test is often depicted as the absolute test for determining machine intelligence. However, there are numerous alternatives that capture the nuances of intelligence more effectively, such as the Winograd Schema Challenge. In this talk, we'll begin by discussing the Turing Test and its shortcomings, including the extremely undefined nature of the test and its simple focus on langauge as a measure of intelligence. After discussing these shortcomings, we'll discuss how they can be remedied in the form of other tests including the Winograd Schema Challenge, the Lovelace Test, and the Visual Turing Test. This talk will be an introspective journey into human perceptions of intelligence, how these perceptions are applied to the machines that we interact with, and why it's perfectly OK for you to yell in the theatre next time the Turing Test is mentioned in a film.</p>

                <p class='session-description'>
                  ES2015 is already production-ready through transpilers such as Babel. Now you no longer need to fight the AMD vs CommonJS war, since you can simply write ES2015 modules, have them transpiled to ES5 and delivered to the browser, which can either happen synchronously (just like CommonJS modules) or asynchronously (just like AMD modules). This talk explains about page performance concerns on the moment you load your code, then it demonstrates how to load ES2015 modules both synchronously (during page load) and asynchronously (lazy-load) using System.js over Babel, as well as how to use JSPM to organize this process and directly resolve dependencies from NPM and GitHub.
                  
                  What will the audience learn:
                  
                  - The fundamentals on when to load your modules (page load time vs lazy loading) for a most optimized page performance
                  - The 3 main module systems in JavaScript: AMD, CommonJS and ES2015 modules
                  - The ES2015 Module Loader spec and System.js
                  - Importing modules synchronously and asynchronously
                  - JSPM as a dependency management system
                  - Optimization strategies

                <p class='session-description'>As object oriented developers, the concept of immutability is more academic than practical. However, with the advent of multi-core processors and the broader adoption of async/await patterns, concurrency becomes an issue. How do you ensure there are no side effects from other processing? Do you use locks and interesting ways of tracking when threads complete? Perhaps we need to adjust our approach to designing systems that are more open to concurrency side effects due to a more imperative style of programming. In this session, I'll talk about some problems that mutable state introduces, and how introducing some immutability concepts into your systems can address these issues. We'll look at events as a time series data store, along with designing your programs to be more functional in nature. We'll even look at this approach with JavaScript by looking at Redux as a stand-alone state store.</p>

                  "Argh, why is this so slow?!" We've all asked questions like this, but we don't always get satisfying answers. And so we slog along, finding workarounds and architecting around the slow bits.
                  
                  But what if we had a friend who could help us find the answers? Someone who could see things we can't. Someone who could tell us whether our guesses were right, and what we might want to check out next.
                  
                  DTrace *is* that friend, and it's here to help! In this talk, I'll show you how DTrace can instrument your operating system to answer incredibly specific questions to test our hypotheses about systems performance, and help us to generate new questions and hypotheses. And along the way, it'll become clear that it's not as scary of a tool as it might first appear!

                  Gone are the days when a single thread or process will max out out CPU capacity. More's Law is at its end and CPUs will only get 
                  more powerful with the addition of more cores. To take full advantage of these new processors computer programmers
                  must understand multithreaded programming and the different models presented to us by our languages, frameworks and processors.  
                  
                  We must understand processes, threads, cores, hyper-threads, native threads and green threads. The differences can be subtle
                  and confusing but they are not difficult to understand. Understanding this technology is key to our high performance future. 
                  
                  This talk will walk through the various threading models provided by common runtimes, we will also discuss the hardware that makes
                  this possible. Leave with an understanding of cores and hyper threads, and learn differences between processes, threads and the 
                  various types of threads presented to us by the runtimes we use and how to take advantage of them.

                  Actor Clustering with Docker Containers and Akka.Net in F#
                  ================================================
                  In this session, you will learn to build and deploy distributed systems combining the power of Akka.Net, the flexibility of F# Remoting, and the simplicity of Docker containers.  The combination of these technologies enhances the effects of F# “code-quotation”, which allows the deployment of arbitrary Actors into remote Actor-Systems.
                   
                  You will learn the basic concepts behind Microservices implemented using the Actor Pattern and Actor Clustering, and how to leverage Docker containers for easy deployment.
                   
                  Docker is the new shining star in the dev-ops world. It allows you to easily deploy images to any OS running Docker, while providing an isolated environment for the applications running inside the container image.  Akka.Net is a framework to build concurrent, resilient, distributed and scalable software systems. The cluster feature lets you distribute your Actors across multiple machines to achieve load balancing, fail-over and the ability to scale up and out.  F# is a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming techniques. During this session we will build and deploy an Actor Cluster to distribute an image recognition system using multiple Machine Learning concepts.

                  ### WebAudio
                  WebAudio is a powerful high-level API for playing, processing and generating audio, making it possible to make sounds and music right in the browser, in plain JS and with no plugins.
                  
                  When used with WebMIDI and Canvas, it is possible to create dynamic interactive experiences, visualizing sound and controlling it from any MIDI capable instrument or controller.
                  
                  ### Basics of Digital Sound Synthesis
                  
                  WebAudio provides an interface similar to "traditional" audio processing and synthesis so we'll cover the basics of sounds from wave frequencies and amplitudes, to oscillators, audio effects and signal routing. The WebAudio building blocks are highly modular and once you understand the flow of audio signals you can make almost anything come out of the speakers.
                  
                  ### Play, Process, Synthesize
                  
                  Stream audio from SoundCloud, add effects, equalize and manipulate the stream, synthesize sound and create music from scratch. It's all possible with different components of the WebAudio API. Making them all work together, you can build intricate devices that don't fall short of other "real" synthesizers and audio players.
                  
                  ### Control and Visualize
                  Finally, by hooking up audio to the MIDI API we can control parameters and playback from a MIDI controller and visualize the sonic creation in a canvas-driven audio visualizer.

                  People will walk from my talk with a better picture of what machine learning is and how, even "__basic__" knowledge of it can be used to in healthcare. Machine learning can evoke images of self-aware automatons and self-guided spaceships. In my talk, I will provide a soft landing for those new to machine learning, show how you can get started in the field and how basic concepts of ML are already being used to impact healthcare. I will do so by:
                  1. Explaining ML (in 5 slides)
                  2. Showing how you can get started with OSS, like [Spark], Python and [R]
                  3. Talk about a couple projects in healthcare that make use of these basic tools.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  Nerves defines an entirely new way to build embedded systems using Elixir. It is specifically designed for embedded systems, not desktop or server systems. Rather than depending on the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files, the Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at startup time:  Elixir. Nerves boots directly to the BEAM VM, giving your Elixir app control of the entire system, just a few seconds after boot.
                  
                  This talk demonstrates several principals of programming embedded devices like Raspberry Pi using Elixir and how Nerves can revolutionize the industry by leveraging the battle tested Erlang VM. Witness live demonstrations from hello world (blinking led's) to controlling 3d printers and unmanned aerial vehicles.
                  
                  Creating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature. The exploration into creating hardware that runs Elixir is geared toward the maker in all of us. Join us for an exciting demonstration into the creation of enhanced embedded systems with Elixir and Nerves.

                  As developers we often do a poor job of implementing cryptography and other security measures in our systems. Often the primitives used are out of date and overlook very subtle flaws. These mistakes lead to systems that are hopelessly insecure despite our perception that we’ve build an impenetrable fortress. Fortunately there are a few tools and techniques at our disposal that can ease some of the pain. In this talk we’ll explore some of the most common pitfalls developers encounter with cryptography and restore some of our sanity.
                  
                  * Specific topics:
                  * Misusing cryptographic primitives
                  * Poor random number generation
                  * Secure password storage
                  * Other subtle flaws that can leave you insecure
                  * Why you should use TLS/SSL and GPG instead
                  * Learn what a group of researches has called "The Most Dangerous Code in the World"

                  Come explore the worlds we create in our minds when trying to write good code, as part of a visual thinking tour of abstractions and interfaces. We write code for humans, which means it runs on brains and has the power to affect those people. We should care about how the worlds we create make people feel, how we can either help or hinder their efforts to change those worlds, and how thinking carefully about interfaces—the edges and coupling points; the maps of our worlds—can give us ways to create better software. We can change how we think about code on a daily basis, so let’s try.
                  
                  We’ll look at and think about memory management, bit shifting, data structures, and OOP, functional, event-driven & procedural programming. We’ll look at web application frameworks, APIs and microservices. There will be some boxes, many arrows and more than a few pieces of real production code; and great documentation. Mostly we’ll be looking at and thinking about ways to be empathic, explicit and kind to other developers.
                  
                  Accompany me on a journey about trying to find a place for everything, and ensuring that everything is in its place. If you write code, I hope to change the way you think about your craft before your fingers fall onto the keyboard, and if you work or live with someone who codes, I hope to give you a system of thinking that will inspire deeper empathy and an enduring curiosity.

                <p class='session-description'>Lately, among web and interaction designers, our designerly griping has taken on a grim flavor. Digital design is not what it used to be, we say. The fun has gone out of it. An endless deluge of frameworks and technologies has leached the creativity out of what we make and do, replacing the joy of craft with a hellish treadmill of overly complicated tools to master. Many of us feel this way, but is it true? And are the challenges facing web designers today really so radically different from those we overcame in the past? Longtime web and interaction designer Jeffrey Zeldman (A List Apart, Designing With Web Standards) compares design then and now, and shows how our oldest and most basic design tools can still stand us in good stead for the challenges of our multi-device, rapidly evolving medium.</p>

                <p class='session-description'>It's all too easy assume that your web or mobile app will run on a fast and reliable network with great coverage. The reality for your app's users, though, is often a slow and unreliable network with spotty coverage. What happens when the network doesn't work, or when the device is in airplane mode? You get unhappy, frustrated users. An offline-first app is an app that works, without error, when there is no network connection. An offline-first app can provide a better, faster user experience — both offline and online — by storing content and data locally and then applying progressive enhancement to synchronize with the cloud when a reliable network connection is available. An offline-first approach can be taken with Progressive Web Apps, mobile apps (native and hybrid), desktop apps (e.g. Electron), and Internet of Things (IoT) apps.</p>

We have nursing rooms for mothers, ramps/elevators for leg disabilities, ergonomic fitting for chairs/desks/keyboards, but making workplaces better for mental health issues lags far behind.
                  
                  We can and should do better! By the end of this talk, we will have learned ways to create a more accommodating workplace including actual workplace changes as well as strategies for communicating and understanding each other more effectively.

                  Software is crufty. Most applications have dark corners that are overly complex, hard to change, or generate lots of bugs. We want to make these areas better, but when the application is large, it can be hard to break down a seemingly insurmountable problem into a series of small, incremental improvements that can be deployed safely.
                  
                  In this talk, Chris will recount how Think Through Math incrementally overhauled a critical component of its Rails app by making small, testable changes. You'll learn why the changes were necessary in the first place, how immutable data structures saved the day, why it's (sometimes) OK to delete tests, and the true cost of waiting too long to clean up the crufty areas of our systems.
                  
                  Come and listen to TTM's story and leave inspired to conquer your system's crufty bits!

                  I'm one of those hybrid designer/developers. Unicorn? No. I failed FizzBuzz in an interview as a result of a self-taught skill-set and an ambiguous job posting. Does that mean I'm not a "real" developer? To some yes, to others no. Then what do I call myself? Am I a liar, a fake? Whatever the case, I'm not alone here.
                  This isn't the impostor syndrome. It's the result of an industry in its awkward twenties; it's identity crisis and it's ego. We aren't fakes, we just don't know how to accurately communicate our skills. In this talk, I'll start by reviewing the heated responses to an article I wrote about the above scenario. Then I'll propose a lexicon for job titles and descriptions in the web industry; a vocabulary that both standardizes our roles, yet allows for the rapidly changing nature of what we do.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  Conversational interfaces are becoming more and more important; there are now A List Apart articles about how to design them, and people are getting more comfortable with them through tools like Siri, Google Now, and Amazon Echo. But these tools have their roots in interactive fiction, which stretches back to "Colossal Cave Adventure" in 1976. I'd like to give attendees a glimpse into that history, and show them how they can contribute to this art/game form that is still popular even now. Because interactive fiction doesn't rely on graphics or dexterity, it's a fantastic place for people to express their creativity - if you can describe it, it can be part of your game. Inform v7 ties right into that, because its syntax basically is English - you write `The Kitchen is a room inside The House.` and you've just created a new place the player can go to.
                  
                  Parchment is a great JavaScript library that lets you take Inform interactive fiction and embed it into any website. It also gives you hooks (through the Vorple project) that let your Inform application use JavaScript on the page it is running in, meaning you could make interactive agents that do anything the web can do. (Exciting!)

                  We're all faced with the pressure to do *more* with less.  Software development has become a commodity in some managers' eyes, and few companies realize all the things that are required to take a product or service from idea to production and beyond.   Whether you're in a small startup or a big corporation, you've got to get more done in less time to stay ahead of the game.
                  
                  ## Enter Code Generation
                  Code generation isn't a new concept, and projects like `yeoman` and `rails` have been using it successfully for years to scaffold a project into a good starting point for you to hone and put into production.   Scaffolding is really only part of the story though.  In this talk I'll show you how to take your code generation skills up to an entirely new level by generating not just a scaffold, but an entire application along with the deployment descriptors (Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests), and documentation (Swagger, apidocs), and any other pieces you need.
                  
                  ## goa - code generation with an easy to use DSL
                  This talk will show you how to use `goa` -- a project that originated as a nice way to generate a JSON API in Go -- to do so much more than generate your API.  You'll see how to create custom generators to create anything you need using a simple to understand and declarative Domain Specific Language.  You'll see how to make your project's `design` DSL idempotent, so that you can make changes to the design and regenerate your project at any time without losing any customizations you've made to the project.  You'll learn how to create a custom DSL for any output that you can dream up.  Perhaps your load balancer requires custom configuration -- using a custom `goa` generator we can build an HAProxy configuration that always stays in sync with your intentions -- because your intentions are stored in your DSL.
                  
                  ## Single Source of Truth
                  By using these concepts you'll be able to make almost your whole infrastructure declarative and versioned in your source code repository.  That concept is called a `Single Source of Truth` and it's the most liberating thing I've ever found in software development.  Using your code as a Single Source of Truth, you'll know that your API Documentation is in sync with what is released in production, because it was generated that way.   You'll never have to worry about your servers being mis-configured during a deployment because that configuration is part of the source code being deployed and _generated by the code being deployed_.
                  
                  ## Now You are 10X
                  Using a DSL to describe your project and all of its outputs means that you can make small changes to your project's design DSL and see a ripple of code generated throughout all the layers of your project.  Much like testing gives you the freedom to refactor with impunity, code generation gives you the freedom to change anything in your stack.  You'll iterate on your projects far faster than you could have previously, with only a small investment up front to create your generators.  You're now 10X.

                  What makes a good software developer, and how do we bring new people with the talents that we need into our industry?
                  
                  In this presentation, Amanda Laucher and Jonathan Graham will share insights from the free programming training that they have been providing in a rural area of SouthWest Pennsylvania, where traditional industries are in decline. They will discuss the approaches they have taken to develop a diverse group of programmers from local residents with no previous coding experience, and the steps they are taking to seed a new tech industry in the area. With constant change within software development a certainty, functional programming concepts have been a core component of the fundamentals that they have taught. Amanda and Jonathan will discuss the skills they have been teaching, techniques that they have used, the people involved, and the many lessons they have learnt along the way.
                  
                  If you think it’s important to give something back to the community, see the value of inspiring people from diverse backgrounds to code, and are interested in the merits of teaching FP first rather than OO, then this talk will be of interest to you.

                <p class='session-time'>1010&mdash;1050</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  We’re all human, and so we all have feelings, but we tend not to be very good at understanding them. Very few of us know where they come from, or what to do when they arrive. Let’s model our feelings like an API and see if it tells us anything. Hint: it does.
                  
                  Imagine you have a public API endpoint which, when called, makes you feel angry. Imagine also that there are thousands of aliases that redirect there. People and situations call any one of those endpoints at any time. It’s up to us to decide what response to send.
                  
                  Why would we want to delve into the messy and uncomfortable world of feelings? Because doing so makes us better developers. Even small increases in emotional mastery can have huge impacts on our careers and productivity:
                  
                  - Difficult family situations
                  - Problematic team mates
                  - Impostor syndrome
                  - Hiring, firing and job interviews
                  
                  The emotions and stresses associated with these situations and others actually destroy our ability to do our jobs. In addition to distracting us and making it harder to maintain our confidence, they actually effect cognition negatively. We literally cannot think as well.
                  
                  With a better grasp of your emotions, and tools to appropriately process them, we can think better, handle stress better and communicate our ideas better. And it’s not just in the context of work: if we know our own feelings, we can understand the feelings of others. By doing that, we make our relationships, our families and our communities better.

                <p class='session-time'>1240&mdash;1320</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  The principles and language of debugging, something technology practitioners understand well, can be used to help them understand diversity and their role in solving the problem. So, technologists already have a set of terms that they can use to tackle diversity. They just need to know how to apply those terms in order to effect positive change. These terms are expected behavior, tracing, refactoring, and sample code.
                  
                  Expected Behavior
                  
                  The first step in understanding a bug in knowing the expected behavior of the system. Similarly, understanding diversity is impossible without knowing the expected behavior of technology environments. Whether it's a workplace, conference, or happy hour, the dominant demographic in technology understands and benefits from the behavior patterns they expect from others. However, they often fail to see how underrepresented groups are often denied those benefits. The ability to see these lapses in expected behavior is vital to helping the dominant demographic understand that the key problem behind diversity is a lack of inclusiveness.
                  
                  Tracing
                  
                  Since software programs are often very complicated, debugging them is often made easier by seeing the output of the underlying code. This is done by tracing which is the practice of displaying lines of code as the program runs. If technologists turn their diversity tracers on, they can see the ways that underrepresented groups are often excluded from information and often exposed to micro-aggressions by the dominant demographic.
                  
                  Refactoring
                  
                  While the allure of adding new features can be powerful, legacy code is made easier to maintain and less costly to develop by refactoring. This is the practice of restructuring and improving the internal design of code without disrupting the functionality of the system. Diversity refactoring is a good way for technologists to begin making the technology industry a more inclusive one. This is the process of improving the internal structure and design of how underrepresented groups are viewed in tech.
                  
                  Sample Code
                  
                  One way to debug code is to see a sample of similar code that runs well. Essentially, another programmer "lends" you code that helps your code work better. Just as a person can "lend" code to another person, a person can "lend" privilege to another person. This can be done by helping underrepresented groups get access to information and events that naturally flow to the dominant demographic in most technology companies.
                  
                  Attendees of this session will leave with an understanding of the diversity in technology problem that is illuminated by terms that they already know. They will gain techniques that they can immediately put into action for making technology the inclusive environment in which we all deserve to build our careers.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  As drones became more popular, I knew that I wanted to try building one.  What really got me interested, however, was learning how flight controller software works.  So, in addition to building the quadcopter itself, I decided to see if I could build and program a flight controller from scratch.
                  
                  In this presentation, I'll be covering the following topics (including live demos!):
                  
                  - some theory behind quadcopter flight
                  - the hardware components that the quadcopter uses to fly (motors, electronic speed controllers, remote control, intertial measurement unit, etc.)
                  - the responsibilities of the flight controller, and how the code works
                  - the iterations of the quadcopters and flight controllers that I built, and what I learned from each one
                  - how to be safe when working on a project like this
                  
                  Whether you're interested in embedded programming, or would just like to learn how quadcopters fly, come watch my journey of learning how to build and program a quadcopter from scratch.

                <p class='session-time'>1510&mdash;1550</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  IoT devices, by design, are meant to infiltrate our daily lives. These devices track our health, they monitor our movements, they ration our energy, they manage our finances. Security in this space is an obvious concern, and the pace of adoption has exceeded the pace of responsible development. Security issues are part of a larger picture. Whereas security analysis typically focuses on protecting against the deliberate actions of a bad actor, the IoT introduces security concerns that don't require a bad actor behaving deliberately. Indeed, even _normal operation_ may cause users harm.
                  
                  Security analysis for IoT therefore must expand beyond the typical "ethical hacker" toolset. In this talk, we'll explore how technical, social, and design factors can introduce harm on the scale of, or greater than, a breach in device security. We'll cover some case studies of software failures that have caused death, how certain industries address security and quality factors, and what concerns should be on the minds of IoT developers. Of particular interest is the role of open source development in the IoT space. The recent `leftpad` incident exposed a systematic issue in how OSS is designed and consumed with respect to the IoT.
                  
                  There will be some technical talk of design failures, current and past, but the talk will be accessible to non-developers as well.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  "The greater your adoption success, the greater your retirement pain." 
                  
                  The number of APIs has exploded and will continue growing as more teams adopt microservices. In my time at Amazon my team of eight owned around 300 microservices, covering every possible life cycle phase. Two of our services were more than a decade old. These lingered despite several interface iterations launched to cover alternative use-cases, multiple ownership changes, and funded retirement initiatives. The reason was simple: hundreds of internal and external clients had a dependency on these services. A coordinated migration effort was nearly impossible to prioritize across the whole of Amazon and integrated third-party merchant software. To make matters worse, many of our clients were as old as the services themselves. Several were owned by teams that had long since forgotten about them. We were all victims of these successful services.
                  
                  As I took over as manager of the team I knew that failure to retire these services in the next year would be a critical blow to our system scalability in Q4. Failure was not an option. I was hellbent on hitting the power switch.
                  
                  Every service owner will eventually encounter this problem. Few want to talk about it. In this session I'll elaborate on the challenges facing service owners, my approach to solving them, the impact of our success, and the lessons learned. I'll share the highs and lows - smooth migrations, and the pain of scream test victims. It is my hope that an attendee will be able to learn from these experiences and succeed in their own retirement efforts.

                <p class='session-time'>1130&mdash;1210</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  _Every_ software project has bugs; today's software systems, many of whom rely on extensive lists of free and open source software dependencies, are incredibly complicated. With so many interacting parts, bugs will slip in despite good software design and automated testing. In this environment, the number of bugs a given piece of software contains is not as important as how prepared and responsive the developer is to handling those bugs, especially when security and privacy are on the line.
                  
                  This talk is about what happens when code reviews and automated testing fail to find a security bug, but the Internet discovers it in production environments. Using examples from real stories, I will discuss why all software projects -- free and open source, as well as proprietary -- should prepare for security vulnerability disclosure, the consequences of ignoring such bug reports, and how to establish and maintain relationships with the security researcher community. I will also talk about the challenges of notifying users and downstream projects through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and provide recommendations and best practices for software development teams and vendors to handle reports of security bugs.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  Over the years, computation has substantially increased our creativity and opportunity.
                  Computers constantly improve along with our ability to create and collaborate toward new art, science, and furthering existing technology.
                  However, there's also a danger in that software becomes difficult to run over time.
                  This fragility leaves us with a tech field that is somehow simultaneously growing and yet narrowing:
                  Word documents become difficult to open, video games on specialized hardware become difficult to play, a researcher's simulator of protein synthesis becomes difficult to find-- these represent a loss of perspective and culture, an inability to revisit the past, and a lack of scientific accountability.
                  
                  In response, librarians have created a collection of digital libraries that archive images, video, and even the most vibrant of GeoCities websites.
                  In the end this is not enough.
                  We have media that is interactive and real-time.
                  We have tools that can create new content at any point.
                  Scientists have a dire need for accountability in research as experiments become harder to replicate.
                  How do we make archives and libraries that can handle the preservation of code while allowing us to -- 100 years from now -- build, run, and archive anything new we create with that code? Where are our museums of interactive art?
                  
                  To answer that, we will take a look at the libraries and archives of the hypothetical, ones that exist now, and those in development.
                  Focusing on the motivations and technology behind them, we will look at what they could do better and how.
                  You will leave with an appreciation for the concept of provenance and how librarians can teach us the importance of systems that can trace an object back to the code that generated it.
                  Finally, a look at the state-of-the-art and how Pittsburgh is leading the effort with two such interactive archives in development centered around using various levels of virtualization to preserve interactive art, games, and scientific experimentation.
                  Our discussion will culminate with a demonstration of these new interactive archive systems, how they work, and what the future looks like.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  At Gratipay, we've discovered a solution to the [problem](https://mako.cc/writing/funding_volunteers/funding_volunteers.html) of distributing revenue to members of an open organization without killing intrinsic motivation: take-what-you-want compensation. This provocative new idea—to give everyone on the team direct control over their own compensation—is not just an idea. We have almost two years of real-world experience with it, and, at a small scale, it works!
                  
                  In this talk I'll briefly state the problem, explain the model we implemented to solve it, and give an overview of how our solution was used by 300+ people across 100+ teams to distribute almost $50,000 over the course of about two years. Then we'll dive deeper into the story of the Gratipay team itself, which saw over 100 people use this method to distribute over $20,000 in revenue amongst themselves. I'll describe when things worked smoothly—and how we handled the inevitable conflicts. I'll end with some thoughts on how the model might scale up.
                  
                  This talk will be fascinating to anyone interested in the question of money and open-source, with implications that go much deeper. Come find out what the future of work could look like!

                <p class='session-description'>
                  What will you do when all of the languages, projects, and frameworks on your resume become obsolete? I left software development in 2005, when no one had heard of "cloud computing," "NoSQL," "DevOps," "big data" and so many other technologies, processes, and paradigms we take for granted today. When I came back to software in 2014 as a refugee from one of many industries being "eaten" by software, I already had a lot to catch up on and I've been stunned by how rapidly things continue to evolve and change. 
                  
                  In this talk, I'd like to share the skills, habits, and mindset that helped me to get caught up after a long absence, and that figure into my plans for career longevity after already having one career path rewired by technological change. As developers, we enjoy some of the greatest creative opportunities and career prospects for the foreseeable future, but the future can be notoriously difficult to foresee and the need to reinvent our careers is a possibility we would do well to prepare for.

                <p class='session-time'>1710&mdash;1750</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  In this talk, Luke will share the latest research from the reknowned Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report and the huge impact these practices have. Since it’s inception, the DevOps Report has surveyed more than 14,000 people and is the most comprehensive study of DevOps practices, tools, and results to date. The 2015 report revealed the critical role that IT leaders play in a company’s DevOps transformation, affirmed that through the power of DevOps and automation, high-performing organizations have 60 percent fewer failures and recover 168 times faster, and demonstrated that DevOps provides a powerful competitive advantage.
                  
                  This year, the report will examine new areas including:
                  
                  * **ROI of IT performance.** Exploring the ROI of IT performance and technical practices to better understand how throughput, stability and quality measures affect the bottom line.
                  * **Security and compliance.** Security and compliance are top of mind in the DevOps space. This year’s survey investigates the role security plays in a DevOps environment.
                  * **Quality.** Past reports have revealed the impact of DevOps practices on key IT performance metrics for throughput and stability. This year’s survey will help to better understand how quality is affected by DevOps practices.
                  * **Containers.** Containers are no doubt changing the IT landscape. The survey will make clear how much containers are truly affecting IT performance.
                  * **Lean.** Last year’s report found that lean management practices such as limiting work in process and creating and maintaining visual displays showing key quality and productivity metrics predict IT performance. This year’s survey will continue diving into lean practices to boost productivity and performance.
                  
                  This talk would be good for practitioners, IT leaders, anyone who has wondered what the value of DevOps is or who has been skeptical of its effects.

                <p class='session-description'>Sketching is a crucial skill that spans all job titles. It helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating our ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, our ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pencil to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching and become a sketching machine. Come prepared to do a fun sketching activity so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand.</p>

The creation of components and their inclusion into applications creates a "supply chain" just like in conventional manufacturing. While physical supply chains have well established chains-of-custody to establish properties like refrigeration maintenance, authenticity or spoilage avoidance, the software supply chain is very much a wild, wild west, filled with vulnerabilities that can be (and are) inadvertently inserted into applications. This presentation describes the parts of the software supply chain, how vulnerabilities have been introduced and the actions that developers can employ to avoid or mitigate the risks inherent in an assembly-based software development strategy.</p>

                  We take on financial debt to enable the purchase of a house, a car, or an education long before we can afford it. We do so assuming that we will be able to make good on the loan, paying it back over time.
                  
                  User Experience Debt is a very similar concept. Our products may acquire debt in the form of technical, functional, behavioral, and visual deficiencies through both responsible and irresponsible actions, and we must address that debt over time. If we don’t deal with UX debt successfully, we will eventually reach a state in which our products are so painful to use that even our existing customers will seek out better tools from our competitors.
                  
                  Stop writing I.O.U.’s to your users. Explore the 15 primary sources of UX debt, both intentional and unintentional, and learn how to identify debt in your products. Then put in place a process by which your team can classify existing debt, prioritize it, and address it. Finally, establish practices for avoiding UX debt in the future.

                  Creating high-value, high-quality technology products is a tough challenge—especially in an age when expectations of users are high, technology is rapidly changing, and competition is fierce. We no longer can rely on how we assume things should work, rather we must understand the unique needs of users and craft ideas to meet their specific needs. That’s where Human-Centered Design (HCD) has the power to significantly transform the way we work and the things we make.  Anyone can practice it and everyone should. Learn how you can be a pro and evangelize others.
                  
                  Attendees will get a brief overview of HCD, understand its value, and gain actionable insights into both failures and successes of experiments in implementing and evangelizing HCD within various contexts and environments.

You can learn to cut to the heart of the disagreement, mediate and move forward.
                  Many of us avoid dealing with tricky situations or let conflict avoidance keep us from accomplishing amazing things together. Conflict can be handled – without flamethrowers – and the process will often make your community stronger. It just takes time, a slightly relaxed ego and a willingness to see the best outcome for the most people. This talk covers when to handle conflict, strategies for both one-on-one situations and group situations and tips on how to scale your conflict resolution skills, like a boss.

                  Matt Griffin (founder, Bearded) has been thinking about
                   what it means to be a ""web designer,"" grappling with the
                   many (and sometimes misunderstood) disciplines that come
                   into play. In undertaking a task no less than defining an
                   industry, he does not dare to go it alone. Instead this
                   talk draws heavily on video interviews shot for his
                   documentary film What Comes Next Is the Future, capturing
                   the thoughts and experiences of industry leaders Trent
                   Walton (founder, Paravel), Irene Au (operating partner,
                   Khosla Ventures), Ethan Marcotte (author, Responsive Web
                   Design), Indi Young (founder, Adaptive Path), Denise Jacobs
                   (author, InterACT with Web Standards), Brad Frost (author,
                   Atomic Design), Yesenia Perez-Cruz, Kelly Goto (founder,
                   gotoresearch), and many more.
                  
                   Much like Carl Sagan in his television series Cosmos, Matt
                   Griffin acts as the guide, helping viewers transition
                   between edited film interview segments where a diverse
                   range of web experts examine the topics at hand:
                  
                   * The legacy of graphic design
                   * Mobile broke our process
                   * Ceding control
                   * Welcoming iteration
                   * You're part of a team
                   * Specialization and overlap
                   * Should designers code?

                  In this fun and playful session I’ll take you on a journey from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 enjoying the sights and delights of its new features along the way. With features like multiplexing, yesterdays best practices are now tomorrow’s anti-patterns - so what does this mean your app or API?
                  This talk explores the best and worst practices of the way the web worked and how HTTP/2 is changing the game for performance. And it’s all explained of course, using jelly snakes and raspberry twizzlers.

                  How to take an app from laptop to production utilizing the future of container technologies. Learn best practices on how to develop and deploy containers across multiple servers using Kubernetes, and open-source framework for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications. 
                  
                  Before merging to “develop”, build containers specific to a feature branch to test integrations, real workloads and validate for quality. Don’t stop at one environment, run as many parallel feature branches as compute is available. 
                  
                  We’ll see how to deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration. Then we’ll understand how to progressively roll out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn’t kill all your instances at the same time. 
                  
                  Find out how containers and its orchestration can promote a clearer separation between “Ops” and “Dev” while enhancing code quality and achieve highly available apps on premise or in the cloud.

                  HTTP/2 (or “H2” as the cool kids call it) has been ratified for months and browsers already support or have committed to supporting the protocol. Everything we hear tells us that the new version of HTTP will provide significant performance benefits while requiring little to no change to our applications – all the problems with HTTP/1.x have seemingly been addressed, we no longer need the “hacks” that enabled us to circumvent them, and the Internet is about to be a happy place, at last!
                  But maybe we should put the pom poms down for a minute! Deploying HTTP/2 may not be as easy as it seems, since the protocol brings with it new complications and issues. Likewise, the new features the spec introduces may not work as seamlessly as we’d hope. In this session, we’ll take a practical look at HTTP/2 and examine some of its core features and how they relate to real-world conditions. We’ll discuss positives, negatives, and new caveats and practical considerations for deploying HTTP/2. Specifically, we’ll cover:
                  The single-connection model, and the impact of degraded network conditions on HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1 How server push interacts (or doesn’t) with modern browser caches What HTTP/2’s flow control mechanism means for server-to-client communication New considerations for deploying HPACK compression Difficulties in troubleshooting HTTP/2 communications, new tools, and new ways to use old tools

                  In this talk I'll present the WHATWG's efforts to standardize "non-standard", often -webkit- prefixed CSS as first-class citizens of the web &mdash; the [Compatibility Living Standard](http://compat.spec.whatwg.org/) We'll learn about the (often controversial!) history of browsers implementing other browser's vendor prefixes and look at landmines, problems and solutions along the way.

                  The marriage between the creative arts and open source technology is slightly unexplored but has exciting and endless possibilities.  For centuries, artists had patrons, giving them months (if not years) of work and steady incomes.  What's unique about having a patron, is the artist must collaborate and form a relationship with this person or affiliation.  Direction will be given, feedback, or ideas exchanged.  There's something really magical that happens when artists are called to explore and create.
                  
                  In retrospect, I did not come from a very commercialized background; my focus in college was children's book illustration and figure painting.  Joining RethinkDB two years ago forced me to work for a brand new audience- one I did not know well at all.  Yet unique methods of storytelling translated well toward branding.  People responded well to characters/mascots, images with strong storytelling like comics, and illustrative t-shirt designs.   When your product is open source, the art can be used to celebrate and document the community.  It can be broad.  It can express itself.  Think Github's Octocat.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  It seems like every day that another company's logo is plastered across the media and they have lost thousands, if not millions of customer records.  This kind of data loss is damaging to a company's reputation and their customers have little control of their private information.  Attackers often want this data for financial gain or to embarrass that company.  
                  
                  There are several methods a malicious attacker will use to gain access to this data.  Injection-based attacks leverage an application's lack of input validation to extract information and allow for unauthorized data access.   In addition, the platform on which the application resides can be leveraged to gain unauthorized admin access and ultimately, data access.  Both scenarios will be discussed and demonstrated in this talk. 
                  
                  Finally, mitigating steps will be discussed at every level of the attack.  The approach will be a defense in depth model that will proactively protect a web application.  While there is no silver bullet against a determined attacker, these mitigations will make their lives more difficult.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  Let's be honest, when we talk about UI design, we're really just talking about **G**UI design. We think in terms of buttons and grids, fonts and images, touch screens and displays. We might throw in sound effects here and there, but those are just bells and whistles (literally). Why do we largely ignore our devices' microphones and speakers? After all, audio is the modality of choice when it comes to interfacing with each other.
                  
                  We have very few examples of consumer-oriented conversational interfaces. In 2016, we can't blame core technology limitations for this deficiency (at least not *completely*). Speech recognition can be accomplished with a web API call, natural-language understanding services are bringing the fruits of machine learning research to the masses, and speech synthesizers no longer sound like robots. You could argue that the tech still has a bit of growing up to do, but Apple II displays only offered 200 monochrome scan-lines and that didn't stop developers from building hundreds of graphical applications for the platform. Thankfully, Oregon Trail was still able to spring into existence.
                  
                  We argue that overcoming core technical limitations is only part of the battle. Before this tech can drive the propagation of robust conversational user interfaces (CUIs) into widespread adoption, we need true **CUI frameworks** to provide the scaffolding that GUI frameworks have been providing for a long time. Without proper abstractions, all time and effort is spent on *how* to use the technology to present an interface, rather than the original design concerns of *what* to present.
                  
                  As a concrete example of what such a framework could consist of for audio interfaces, we'll discuss SayKit, an iOS SDK created to provide a native framework for CUI development inspired by Apple's own native GUI framework (UIKit). We'll discuss the various design decisions that went into creating SayKit and how we believe it can help foster a new wave of conversational applications. Finally, we'll show a few live examples along with the straightforward code underlying them.
                  
                  In particular, the talk will tackle the following topics:
                  
                  - The promise of conversational UIs
                  - Their history (or lack thereof) in consumer applications
                  - A UI framework's role in a developer's arsenal
                  - Why the existing patchwork of voice services alone cannot fulfill that role
                  - How SayKit was built to provide a structured, intuitive, and declarative approach to authoring conversational interfaces

                <p class='session-time'>1420&mdash;1500</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  At Kickstarter, we’ve created a GitHub for Poets training class to introduce all employees to our engineering process and the codebase that runs kickstarter.com, regardless of their role or department.
                  
                  The one-hour class introduces attendees to making branches, commits, and pull requests using the GitHub Flow in a web browser. It’s a simple workflow, but the effects are profound.
                  
                  GitHub for Poets training has resulted in streamlined communication with our product team, and has demystified software development. Other teams are increasingly able to make copy changes in our code. People love seeing their handiwork live on the site.
                  
                  Since introducing GitHub for Poets:
                  
                  * The Customer Support team can seamlessly improve messaging on the site in response to tickets
                  * The Editorial team can quickly fix typos
                  * The HR Director can directly update job listings
                  
                  Kickstarter’s culture has strengthened as teams seek the transparency, inclusivity, and contextual history afforded by Git for all their work. Internal documentation moved to Git repos. Policy discussions moved from email to pull requests.
                  
                  In this talk, I’ll discuss tips for teaching a successful GitHub for Poets class, and the processes you should have in place to allow your staff to learn your codebase without compromising site reliability or security.

                <p class='session-time'>1510&mdash;1540</p>
                <p class='session-description'>
                  Have you ever hit a wall with REST? Does modeling your problem domain into CRUD-able entities feel like fitting a square peg into a round hole?  Perhaps instead of modeling our services like little databases, we should instead model them like reactors to event streams.
                  
                  REST APIs are great, but their typical implementation tightly couples various concerns that would be better separated:
                  
                  * Reads (perception) from writes (action)
                  * Current state from historical narrative
                  * Business logic from HTTP design from operational concerns like metrics and monitoring
                  
                  Commander is a pattern for writing REST APIs that de-couples these concerns, thereby alleviating common frustrations with CRUD-flavored REST.  This pattern imposes a clear separation of action from perception, and uses immutable values conveyed by Kafka and the Kafka Streams library to separate business logic from HTTP concerns, all while preserving the historical narrative of the entire event stream.
                  
                  In this talk, I'll discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of this approach, and demonstrate my implementation using Clojure in the HTTP layer, and using Java with the new Kafka Streams library in the event stream processing layer.

                  You’re smart, educated, and you’ve been working in this industry for years. You’ve created amazing open-source packages and great documentation. But all that flies out the window if what you write about your project isn’t being read.
                  
                  “But it’s comprehensive! It has all the info that I would need!” you may reply.
                  
                  The problem is not writing for people like you; it’s writing and creating documentation that anyone can read, understand, and get excited about. This is true for projects aimed at beginners, but it goes double for projects and writing aimed at intermediate/expert programmers. Your projects will benefit when you write something that everyone can understand and would want to read. More readers = more users = perhaps more contributors!

                  It seems like a funny joke the first time you hear it. How could someone forget about a server that cost thousands of dollars? How is it possible that nobody knows what it does? If it's important? Where it even *is?*
                  
                  Yet, it's not a joke. Many companies young and old, fast and slow, large and small, face this problem. Antiquated, under-documented, or poorly understood code, infrastructure, and process can quickly and surprisingly become completely invisible to an entire organization and the people within it. This phenomenon is hard to eliminate, and many organizations simply try to encourage humans to be smarter and not fall into the traps that lead to these surprising situations.
                  
                  Humans are dumb at remembering stuff, but pretty smart at telling computers what to do. This talk covers some of the technical and social hacks you can use to prevent, discover, and destroy invisible infrastructure.

                  Failure
                  
                  It's not a pretty word. Even hearing it probably brings back a memory, recent or otherwise, of a time in your career where you simply felt lost. A project ships late, if even at all. An idea you publicly championed doesn't pan out. A coworker earns a deserved promotion that you were also working towards. An MVP crashes and burns.  Someones design is chosen by the team over your own as the one to go with. The ways in which failure can manifest are limitless.
                  
                  It's not comfortable to talk about, either. We live in an industry where you're seemingly inundated with success stories everywhere you go. Some new startup that has a ludicrous idea, just got more money in VC funding than you'll ever see in your life.  Or they were bought by any of the prestigious "acquisitors" in the world, elevating not only their bank accounts, but also their status among their peers, and really the world. Talking about your failures only seems to bring more light to the fact that you aren't them - and the feeling that the more people know of your failures, the further you are from success begins to sink in.
                  
                  But failure is important to talk about - it's important to embrace and to celebrate in many ways. No one is telling you to feel great about failing, but there is a lot of value in missing your mark that is easy to miss, and invaluable for teaching you how to keep refining your own personal process to learn how to succeed - even if it means redefining what you consider "success" to be.
                  
                  In this talk, I'll use anecdotes and stories from my own career to highlight the myriad ways in which I've encountered failure, what I was able to take away from those experiences, and how I've come to view failure and success as driving factors for my future work. I would hope that anyone listening to this talk would take away from it a greater sense of confidence in themselves, and also a larger sense of community - There are a lot of people out there with stories like these, with stories like mine and like yours, and we as a community should be embracing that.

                  Wouldn’t it be great if we could spend less time trying to style the markup we’ve been handed, and more time creating a system of smart, reusable design components?
                  
                  Well, we’re in luck. With the increased popularity of pattern libraries and the proliferation of templating languages, we finally have the tools to create and deploy our own design systems.
                  
                  But what is a design system, and how do we create them? What rules should it follow? How do I get my team on board?
                  
                  In this talk I will be pulling wisdom and insight from my past two years of creating a design system for Redhat.com. I will explain what we call our “Road Runner Rules”, which influence every piece of code that we write.
                  
                  I’ll be covering topics such as:
                  
                  - Atomic Modular Design
                  - Element Queries
                  - Single-selector CSS with BEM/BEDAM
                  - Data Attributes Driven Modifiers
                  - Style Guides
                  - Pattern Libraries
                  - Design System Team Exercises
                  - Tips for Creating User Stories
                  
                  It doesn’t matter if you are a designer who wants to learn how to turn your visual language into a design system, or a developer who wants to create more modular components, you’ll want to sit in on this session and learn from the successes and failures of creating a large scale design system.

                <p class='session-description'>
                  These days the blossoming DevOps landscape has given everyone the tools to adopt microservices. And it’s not about replacing a monolith with a set of REST APIs: the pressure of one such service going down usually causes chain reactions and results in lost data at best.
                  
                  You can stay agile at scale by building pub/sub services that communicate via queues and messages buses. And if you build them with the Unix mindset of doing one thing well, you end up with a particular style of microservices that are incredibly fun to write and fast to deploy.
                  
                  If your team is spending more time solving technical problems than shipping value to users, come learn how to get started with this simple, elegant approach of building software. We’ll see what asynchronous microservices look like in code, what tools we need to adopt in order to deploy them efficiently, and you’ll gain a whole new way to think about programming.

                  Our culture’s workforce defaults to internships, which have a reputation for being short-term, involving lots of coffee runs, and are usually limited to college students. With the changes in both the tech and college industries -- more people without CS degrees pursuing careers in tech -- what if we brought back the apprenticeship model?
                  In this talk, we will examine what apprenticeships have historically been, why we shifted to the internship model, and what we can gain by adding apprenticeships back into our normal work environments -- especially in our industry. I will share both historical research and present-day case studies. You will leave equipped with the base knowledge you need to implement apprenticeships at your own company, and you will know how to get the most value out of an apprenticeship as either a company or an apprentice.

                  Usually we think of compound interest as what adds magically to our retirement or makes our student loans last forever. But there is also a compound interest of technical debt, where a project is made harder and more expensive because of early "cost-saving" choices.
                  
                  I think it's empowering for developers and other people involved in the inception of a project to have tools for making the project better long-term.
                  
                  The seven things I think should be considered very early in development are:
                  
                  1.  Localization. Are you ever planning on selling this to someone in another country?
                  
                  2.  Security. Don't be the organization that has to pay someone for disaster PR. Building in security early saves you a bunch of time and user churn later.
                  
                  3.  Extensibility. What makes you so sure this API will always be internal?
                  
                  4.  Documentation. People do not buy software solely based on Powerpoints. You need public docs. The docs have to be more useful than Stack Overflow.
                  
                  5.  Affordance. UI is not a word. The microtext matters.
                  
                  6.  Acceptance. Have you shown this to any actual humans who are like the users?
                  
                  7.  Accessibility. We all use computers different ways. Does your software allow that?
                  
                  
                  I expect this talk will be relevant to both senior people working on leading project teams, and empowering for juniors who don't have a structure for critiquing usability problems. I want people to leave with an understand of how small changes in the initial trajectory of a project can lead to greatly improved outcomes.

                  Specification documentation (requirements documents, design documents, etc) are important artifacts in a software development environment. As soon as these artifacts are created, they quickly become outdated as soon as fingers hit keys and an application morphs and adapts to address problems. Often these updates do not get noted in the documentation. Documents are either abandoned or there is a mad dash to slap together something that is "good enough." When there are multiple sources of documentation (document artifacts, wikis, issue trackers, commit messages, etc), then if the specifications are updated in one place, the specifications are deprecated in others and vice versa.
                  
                  Ideally, we can maintain a single source of information where people actually interact with and act on the data. Teams primarily interact with and make changes in issue trackers, wikis, and code repositories. Customers may consume document artifacts, but that is ultimately all they are: artifacts. They should not be working drafts, but a presentation of curated information contained in the actionable repositories of issue trackers, wikis, and code repositories.

                  When we shipped our big re-write of Bugsnag’s customer-facing dashboards as a 40,000 line React app, first we celebrated ... and then we looked at our client-side monitoring and did a lot of head-scratching. We’d tested in multiple browsers and thought through dozens of use cases, but when we looked at the kinds of real errors coming back to us from the wild, the reality was so much weirder than we'd expected.
                  
                  As client-side app frameworks like React and Ember keep growing more popular, we're shipping more and more application logic out to users' browsers. But most of us never find out much about what happens to it after we send it out to the client. This talk will take you on a fast-paced tour of all the strange cases we’ve looked at since shipping our new dashboard, from overseas proxy sites to rogue browser extensions to out-and-out clones of our UI. Finally, we’ll talk about how to cut the noise and focus on monitoring and mitigating the cases that really matter to your users’ experience.

                  ### The Analytics of Social Progress: When Machine Learning meets Human Problems
                  
                  In recent years, machine learning has fueled advances in logistics, retail, media consumption, health care, finance and banking.  These solutions have earned relatively few people a lot of money!
                  
                  Can machine learning also be applied to social problems for the betterment of all? 
                  
                  [Presenter's Name], Data Scientist, will discuss four real world problems tackled in 2015 by Data Science for Social Good fellows (dssg.io):
                  
                  1.  Identifying police officers at an increased risk of adverse public interaction
                  
                  2.  Early detection of high school students not on track to graduate
                  
                  3.  Locating blighted homes in Cincinnati, and
                  
                  4.  Targeting supporters for online political activism and fundraising
                  
                  Focusing on the opportunities and risks of applying math to human service, we will discuss the basics of supervised machine learning and the implications of applying math to community: when is it helpful and how can we assure that it is not perpetuating systemic bias? 
                  
                  Come if you’ve always wondered what machine learning/analytics really means, or if you are interested in math solutions to social justice problems.

                  What do you get when you hook up a phone number to a web service to a microcontroller to a strand of LED lights? A Christmas Tree that you can text a color to and watch it immediately light up. A few years ago I threw together a prototype of this idea over a weekend, and had fun watching reactions when I brought it into the office. The following year I refactored and improved it, adding voice commands, a Slack integration, and a few other easter eggs… using it as a playground to try new things and experiment.
                  
                  Come see the little trees in action, and learn about all the technologies and services that makes the magic work, including Twilio, Keen, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Slack’s API, the Web Speech API in Chrome, a Particle Photon, and LEDs from Adafruit. Dig in and you’ll have enough time to build your own for the holidays!
                  
                  For more advanced attendees, API endpoints for the tree will also be provided, so you can swing by and hack together your own custom integration idea on the spot.

                  In 2014, my family had had enough of the typical 9 to 5. I tried the startup thing, I tried the corporate thing, I tried the non-profit thing. None of it was fulfilling. And the repetition of it all was driving me crazy. So we sold everything we had, bought an RV, and hit the road.
                  
                  I'll talk through what led us to do this, how it's been going, and provide a few different ways for people to dip their toes into this lifestyle: from weekend warriors, short-term trips, international travel, and full-time travel. If you're a programmer, you have a TON of options to work from the road. I'd love to let people know they're not stuck and give them ideas on how to see the world -- not just a dark cubicle.

                  # Yoga for Engineers
                  
                  ## Why?
                  Sitting at a desk all day contributes to the already typically sedentary lifestyle of the modern world. There are many studies that show that our bodies do not deal well with this lack of activity. _Yoga for Engineers_ will help us to stand up and do something about it.
                  
                  ## But I'm pretty healthy, why do I need this?
                  That's great! Maybe you don't, but you will probably have fun anyway! You might even learn something new.
                  
                  ## But I'm not flexible at all, yoga isn't for me.
                  That's why you try yoga! There are plenty of alternate postures if you can't do a thing. Plus, it's not about doing everything (or really, anything) perfectly, it's about the journey of getting better with continuous practice.
                  
                  ## So what will I get out of it?
                  My goal is to teach a few easy exercises and yoga postures that you can do at home (and some, even at the office) that will help to strengthen the muscles that are weakened by sitting in a chair. You can learn about them more in depth at my _Posture for Engineers_ talk, and give them a try in the _Yoga for Engineers_ workshop.
                  
                  At the end of this workshop you will: 
                  
                  * Feel more confident about moving your body during your work day.
                  * Learn some yoga poses if you did not know them already.
                  * Know at least a few exercises to do regularly that will help improve posture.
                  * Have experienced what each position will do for you.
                  * Have tried something fun ^_^
                  * Be smiling!

                  Firebase is Google’s full stack NoSQL cloud platform that allows developers to build extraordinary realtime mobile and web apps.
                  
                  Badi will take you on a wild ride of coding with Firebase’s JavaScript APIs to build a real-world application. Then we sprinkle AngularJS in the mix and voila – you get something really special called the “Three-Way Binding” and a lot less code. You will get to see how this is a whole lot better than the two-way binding AngularJS provides. We will then explore a few more features of Firebase—user authentication in particular. You will see me live coding a single JavaScript function to authenticate users of our app on social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. 
                  
                  I can assure you this - you will leave this talk itching to try this blissful combination out on your current and future projects!

                <p class='session-description'>
                  What do you think of when I say MIDI, bad computer music? Websites playing annoying background noise when you land on them? Then let me let you into a little secret, let me introduce  and educate you into a new world of MIDI.
                  
                  MIDI is at it’s simplest a data protocol and doesn’t have to be associated with audio at all. With the incredible amount of compatible hardware available to us, alongside the new Web MIDI API, we can start to have a *lot* of fun with a new world of hardware-powered web tech.
                  
                  In this enticing and interactive presentation we’ll journey through the different MIDI specifications and look at other web APIs. From sound with General MIDI and the Web Audio API, to the MIDI Show Control, timing firework and fountain displays with the Web Animation API and on to the latest MIDI BLE standard, what a better way to demo the Web Bluetooth API.
                  
                  The web is getting hardware-ready and this talk is a great beginning to those APIs at our fingertips. Think you know MIDI - think again there’s so much more to it.

                  Kubernetes is a powerful, open source, container orchestration / cluster management tool created by Google. It draws upon all the lessons learned from a near-decade of using containers at Google.
                  
                  There are a number of tools available to spin up containerized environments with Docker on a single host and tear down just as fast. The difficulty is when trying to deploy across two or more servers. Kubernetes is solves just that problem by allowing you to manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system.
                  
                  See how to create your own Raspberry Pi cluster to deploy at scale all while demonstrating real chaos monkey failure handling by pulling plugs from random nodes! We’ll also demonstrate different tools to visualize what’s happening in the system through various web interfaces as well as using Minecraft!

                  Join us for this public “distraction” where we’ll use Human-Centered Design methods to envision innovative solutions around a central theme of the conference. Over the course of three days, we’ll take time to unpack the problem, generate a wide range of ideas, and vote and prioritize solutions so attendees can take actionable items with them.
                  
                  We plan to crowd-source these problems, ideas, and solutions by setting up in a prominent location and inviting people to casually stop by and participate. Over the course of a day, or the conference as a whole, attendees could see HCD methods in progress and gain perspective and a working understanding of the process. They can also walk away with some new ideas around the chosen topic that they could use when they go back to work.
                  
                  Goals of this distraction include:
                  *Encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration
                  *Observing and participating in HCD methods firsthand
                  *Providing actionable strategies for post-conference innovation
                  *Opportunities for any and all attendees to participate
                  *Creating an interactive way for attendees to meet each other

                <p class='session-description'>
                  In this live demo, I will help you learn about pointers, assembly, and Lua scripting to find new ways to enjoy your favorite games. I intend to do so by showing you how variables in memory are laid out in one of my favorite games, Spelunky.
                  
                  Spelunky is a procedurally-generated platformer game which, behind the scenes, tracks the player’s progress as they play through the game. Using a memory scanner and re-assembler tool called Cheat Engine, we can both view these values and modify these values to make the game easier, make it more difficult, or add new ways to play.
                  
                  I invite you to come play my modded version of Spelunky and peek under the hood at the values it’s using in memory to construct the world you’re playing in. Once you have a feel for that you can even change those memory values while you’re playing to try out all new styles of play.
                  
                  I originally became interested in this for the purpose of broadcasting my gameplay, with the intention of automatically generating a display for viewers to see statistics that weren’t normally kept by the game. While I could have just tracked this value by hand, I wanted to see if I could harvest information from the game itself and present it directly to anyone watching. After writing some scripts to track and display those numbers, I found a slew of other values that directly affected the state of the game.
                  
                  I’ll be sharing the techniques that I used to explore the game’s memory. My goal is to give you a fundamental knowledge of memory introspection tools which you can use to dig into and augment your favorite game or program. I hope you are inspired to go explore, modify, and break!
